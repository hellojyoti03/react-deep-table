# Technology Stack Overview

This project uses a modern and robust set of technologies to deliver a scalable, maintainable, and efficient application. Below is an overview of the technologies and tools used across the application.

## Frontend

### 1. **React.js**
- **Version**: 18.x
- **Description**: React.js is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs). It enables the creation of reusable UI components.
- **Why React?**: React allows us to build dynamic, responsive, and interactive user interfaces with a fast development cycle. Itâ€™s highly performant due to its virtual DOM, and has a large ecosystem of tools and libraries.
  
### 2. **TypeScript**
- **Version**: 4.x
- **Description**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types. It helps catch type-related bugs during development and improves the maintainability of the codebase.
- **Why TypeScript?**: TypeScript improves code quality, increases developer productivity, and reduces runtime errors. It integrates seamlessly with React and provides better tooling (such as autocompletion and type-checking) during development.

### 3. **React Router**
- **Version**: 6.x
- **Description**: React Router is used for handling navigation and routing within a React application. It allows for single-page application navigation without reloading the entire page.
  
### 4. **Redux Toolkit**
- **Version**: 1.x
- **Description**: Redux is a state management library that helps manage and centralize the application's state. Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended approach to writing Redux logic with less boilerplate code.
- **Why Redux?**: Redux simplifies managing complex application state and ensures a consistent state across the app, especially for larger applications with many components.

### 5. **Styled Components**
- **Version**: 5.x
- **Description**: Styled Components is a library for writing CSS in JavaScript. It allows us to style our React components using tagged template literals.
- **Why Styled Components?**: It promotes component-based styling, eliminates global CSS issues, and offers better scalability and modularity for large applications.



## Backend

### 6. **Java (Spring Boot)**
- **Version**: 2.x
- **Description**: Spring Boot is a Java-based framework used for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications. It simplifies the development of backend services by providing pre-built solutions for common problems.
- **Why Java & Spring Boot?**: Spring Boot is widely used for building RESTful APIs, and its extensive ecosystem of tools makes it ideal for enterprise-level backend development. It offers good support for microservices architectures, security, and database management.

### 7. **Spring Security**
- **Version**: 5.x
- **Description**: Spring Security is a powerful and customizable authentication and access-control framework for Java applications.
- **Why Spring Security?**: It provides comprehensive security features out of the box, including authentication, authorization, and protection against common vulnerabilities like CSRF and XSS.


## APIs & Database

### 8. **RESTful API**
- **Description**: The backend communicates with the frontend via REST APIs, which provide a simple and scalable way to send and receive data between the client and the server.
- **Why RESTful APIs?**: REST APIs are lightweight, stateless, and easy to implement. They offer a flexible way to interact with various types of clients (like web browsers, mobile apps, etc.).

### 9. **PostgreSQL**
- **Version**: 13.x
- **Description**: PostgreSQL is an open-source, relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its robustness, extensibility, and support for complex queries.
- **Why PostgreSQL?**: PostgreSQL provides a solid, reliable platform for managing relational data. It supports advanced features like JSON data types, full-text search, and ACID transactions.

## Development Tools

### 10. **Webpack**
- **Version**: 5.x
- **Description**: Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It allows us to bundle all our JavaScript, CSS, and other assets into a single file or a few optimized files for better performance.
  
### 11. **Docker**
- **Version**: 20.x
- **Description**: Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight containers.
- **Why Docker?**: Docker ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, from development to production. It simplifies dependency management and enables easy scaling.

### 12. **Jest**
- **Version**: 27.x
- **Description**: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook. It works well with React and is used for unit testing, integration testing, and snapshot testing.
- **Why Jest?**: Jest provides a fast and easy-to-setup testing environment. Its snapshot testing and built-in mocking features make it ideal for React applications.

## DevOps & Deployment

### 13. **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**
- **Description**: GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. It automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code.
- **Why GitHub Actions?**: GitHub Actions integrates seamlessly with GitHub repositories, allowing for streamlined automated workflows that ensure high-quality, reliable deployments.

### 14. **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**
- **Services**: EC2, RDS, S3
- **Description**: AWS provides cloud computing services like virtual servers (EC2), managed databases (RDS), and object storage (S3) that we use to host our backend and store static files.
- **Why AWS?**: AWS offers a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective cloud infrastructure that powers enterprise-level applications with minimal management overhead.
