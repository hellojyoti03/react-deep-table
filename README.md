        {
          id: 2,
          name: "Subcategory 1.1",
          value: "Value 1.1",
          status: "Inactive",
          date: "2024-11-20",
          children: [
            { id: 3, name: "Item 1.1.1", value: "Value 1.1.1", status: "Active", date: "2024-11-10" },

          id: 4,
          name: "Subcategory 1.2",
          value: "Value 1.2",
          status: "Active",
          date: "2024-10-30",
        },
      ],
    },
  ];

	const headerData = ['ID', 'Name', 'Value', 'Status', 'Date']
  

	return (
		<div>
			 <Table body={demoData} header={headerData} />
		</div>
	);
};

export default TableComponent;
```

## Customization

`react-deep-table` customize the buttons by applying your own styles and configurations. Hereâ€™s how you can enhance the appearance and behavior of your buttons:

### Custom Children

You can pass any React node as children to the share buttons, allowing you to use custom images, SVGs, or text. This gives you the flexibility to design buttons that fit your application's branding.

### Example

```javascript
let COSTUM_STYLE_OBJECT = {
  border: '1px solid #ddd',
  headerColor: "#007BFF",
  footerColor: "#28A745",
  bodyColor: "#F8F9FA",
  tableColor : "#FFFFFF",
}


<Table costumStyle={COSTUM_STYLE_OBJECT}  costumClass = 'react-deep-table'>
```
